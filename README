CCN Car Racing Game
by Zening Qu 05/08/2012 quzening@gmail.com

This is a multiplayer on-line car racing game using Content Centric Network (CCN) as its network component. We want to make a game that is scalable, synchronized and purely distributed on CCN.

This game is adapted from the Unity Car Tutorial (http://unity3d.com/support/resources/tutorials/car-tutorial) which has all the physics simulation but lacks network and other players. We want to make this into a networked game by adding the CCNx plugin (https://github.com/CherryQu921/CCNxPlugin) into the game.

Feature List:
- Use CCN Synchronization protocol and CCN Repository Protocol to do game discovery and player discovery.
- After game and players are discovered, normal interest/content will be sent/received for state synchronization such as position, rotation etc. Prediction/Error Correction algorithms will be used.
